Hello there!

This is the first step of my attempt to create an application to aid in the learning of Brazilian JiuJitsu. 

My app is not close to what I have envisioned, but I have not yet given up hope. 


THE IDEA:


Each user would enter their username, create a password, and select their belt level. Eventually, belt colors would instead be used to designate subscription tiers, but that's far away.
Ideally, the app was thought of as a way to interact with positions and techniques from JiuJitsu using the same mental, step-by-step process that is required on the mats. 
The idea was for the basic outlines of the main positions to be rendered down the left hand side of the screen in a column, with additional details availible on click. 
Eventually, the additional details click would also render photos or a video of the position, as well as links to techniques (sweeps, submissions, guard passes, etc.) specific to that position. 
As more development is completed on the app, more advanced positions and techniques will be added. 


THE END GOAL:


The end goal would see the application linked to a private YouTube channel where I would demonstrate the techniques featured in my app.

As you'll see if you launch my app, it's not there yet.
But it is on the way.
I'll continue plodding away at this, and using this app to test out different things I learn, in both coding and JiuJitsu.




Thanks for stopping by, check back for updates!
