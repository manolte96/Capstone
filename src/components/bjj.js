  BJJ, also called "the gentle art," exists as an evolvolution of Judo, paying more attention to what finishes the fight once it has been brought to the ground. Following a public lesson by a travelling Japanese judoka, Mitsuyo Maeda, in 1917, a family of brothers with the surname "Gracie" devleoped those technicques into "Gracie JiuJitsu" and began to popularize the sport in Brazil. A son (Rorion) of one of those brothers (Helio) moved to the United States in 1978, and co-founded the Ultimate Fighting Championship in 1993. Today, almost 30 years later, JiuJitsu gyms span the planet Earth and thousands of people are practicing and enjoying the gentle art every day.

  <h2>Understanding Positions and the Players</h2>
JiuJitsu positions are comprised of a combination of the two players. The vast majority of exchanges in JiuJitsu come from a configuration of the two players where one has been put to the mat, either by their own decision or their opponent's, and the other person is now over them. We may refer to these two players as the "Top Player" and the "Bottom Player" with respect to their various positions. A Bottom Player will ALWAYS be looking to escape "Mount" positions, and achieve some version of a "Guard" position. The Top Player, then, will ALWAYS be looking to move through, or "pass" their opponent's "guard" in order to achieve one of the various "Mount" positions. This is important to remember as we begin to look at how the positions are connected.

  <h3>Open Guard</h3> 
Open Guard occurs when one player elects not to engage in a traditional wrestling exchange, and instead elects to begin the match seated. The other player now becomes the Top Player and will look to advance position from <a href="#fullguard">full guard</a> into a <a href="#halfguard">half guard</a> and so on through to the various mounts.
